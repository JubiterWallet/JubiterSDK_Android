+ JUB_SignTransactionTRX & JUB_PackContractTRX
  + Fix the bug of protobuf serialization for message FreezeBalanceContract and UnfreezeBalanceContract. When resource == bandwidth, pb will not encode this item, so we need to override it's serialize(). It's known that this bug is not present in ProtoBuf in Dart, but in both C++ and Objective-C.
